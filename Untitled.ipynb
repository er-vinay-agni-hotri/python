    "Going from solving problems using any means necessary to solving problems using only data may feel like a small step for a computer, but it has been a huge step for humanity (figure 1.2). Once upon a time, if we wanted to get a computer to perform a task, we had to write a program, namely, a whole set of instructions for the computer to follow. This process is good for simple tasks, but some tasks are too complicated for this framework. For example, consider the task of identifying if an image contains an apple. If we start writing a computer program to develop this task, we quickly find out that it is hard.Going from solving problems using any means necessary to solving problems using only data may feel like a small step for a computer, but it has been a huge step for humanity (figure 1.2).
